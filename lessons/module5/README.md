The PhoneGap Enterprise viewer provides the ability for both developers and marketers to easily review their mobile enterprise apps. The tight integration with Adobe Experience Manager also allows for all of an app’s metadata to be viewed. The result is a fast and easy way for PhoneGap Enterprise apps to be tested and used by others at any given stage of development across multiple devices.

### Exercise 1 – Launch Viewer
